Micro-Motor
===========

**Design of a micro single-phase induction motor**

Mechanical Electricity-meter use single-phase induction motor. The same design can be used as a micro-motor because of its simple structure and robustness. The project will be more hands-on approach to modify the design for micro-manufacturing techniques.

**Statement of Purposes**
* To learn the general working principle of a mechanical electricity meter
* To simulate the motor in a finite-element software for scaling-down in micro dimensions
* To investigate required manufacturing techniques in this dimensions

The project is being developed under [STAR Projects](http://star.eee.metu.edu.tr/), [Electrical-Electronics Engineering](http://eee2.metu.edu.tr/), [METU](http://www.metu.edu.tr/).
