micro-motor
===========

**Design of a micro single-phase induction motor**

Mechanical Electricity-meter use single-phase induction motor. The same design can be used as a micro-motor because of its simple structure and robustness. The project will be more hands-on approach to modify the design for micro-manufacturing techniques.

The project is being developed under [STAR Projects](http://star.eee.metu.edu.tr/), [Electrical-Electronics Engineering](http://eee2.metu.edu.tr/), [METU](http://www.metu.edu.tr/).
